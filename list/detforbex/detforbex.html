        <p class="lead">The company was founded by brothers A. S. F. Rahman and Salman F Rahman in 1972, soon after the establishment of the Bangladeshi Republic. Their family was earlier engaged in the jute industry of East Pakistan, which once the world's largest jute producer and exporter. The family business was affected by a nationalisation program in Bangladesh during the early 1970s. However, with free market reforms in the late 1970s and 1980s, the family regained many of their businesses.

Since the 1970s, Beximco has been a pioneer in Bangladeshi industry, including the modern textile sector, pharmaceuticals, ceramics and information and communication technology.

In 2005, Beximco Pharma became the first Bangladeshi company to list on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange.[5] It also opened its first overseas retail outlet with the launch of the Yellow clothing brand in Karachi, Pakistan.[6] Yellow has since expanded to several Bangladeshi and Pakistani cities. In 2009, Shinepukur Ceramics opened a showroom in Moscow, Russia.[7] In 2010, the company acquired stakes in several major Bangladeshi businesses, including IFIC Bank, GMG Airlines, The Independent newspaper and Unique Hotels and Resorts.[8][9][10]

The company is considered to enjoy close connections with the Awami League, with Salman F Rahman serving as a Private Sector Development Affairs Adviser to Prime Minister and Bangladesh Awami League President Sheikh Hasina, the current Prime Minister of Bangladesh.[4] Products
