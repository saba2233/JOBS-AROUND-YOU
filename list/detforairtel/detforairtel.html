In 2010, Warid Telecom sold a majority 70% stake in the company to India's Bharti Airtel Limited for US$300 million. Bharti's proposal also included an initial $300-million investment in Warid for creating new shares in the company.[1][2] The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission approved the deal on 4 Jan 2010.[3] Bharti Airtel Limited took management control of the company and its board, and re-branded the company's services under its own 'airtel' brand from 20 December 2010.

In March, 2013, Warid Telecom sold its rest 30% share to Bharti Airtel's Singapore-based concern Bharti Airtel Holdings Pte Limited for US$85 million.[4][5][6]

On 8 September 2013, Airtel Bangladesh received 5  MHz of the 3G spectrum at US$1.25 million.
