        <p class="lead">After the partition of India in 1947, Pakistan Tobacco Company was established in 1949. The first factory in Bangladesh (the then East Pakistan) was setup in 1949 at Fauzdarhat in Chittagong. In 1965, the second factory of Pakistan Tobacco Company went into production in Mohakhali, Dhaka. Thereafter it became Bangladesh Tobacco Company Limited in 1972 immediately after Bangladesh's independence. In 1998, the Company changed its name and identity to British American Tobacco Bangladesh (BAT Bangladesh) aligning the corporate identity with other operating companies in the British American Tobacco Group.

BAT Bangladesh is a part of British American Tobacco plc, one of the world’s most international businesses, with brands sold in more than 200 markets around the world.

We make high quality tobacco products for the diverse preferences of consumers, spanning the business 'from crop to consumer' and we are committed to embedding the principles of corporate social responsibility Group wide.
